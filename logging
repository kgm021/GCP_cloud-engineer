cloud logging  -------------------> log router ---------------> destination



  logs which are written to cloud logging api are pass through the  log router. whenevr logs are entry arrives. logging compares the log entry to the filters of the sinks associated with resource

1. sink in log router check each log entry  against existing inclusion and exclusion fliters that determine if the log entry should be sent to storage destinations or any other destinations.

2. sinks route logs entries to storage destinations and used to exclude logs entries that are being written to cloud logging(filter and destination)

3. Two pre-defined log sinks for each google cloud project 
    1. _Required
       admin activity audit logs, system event audit logs, access transparency logs are moved to _required logs
    2. _Default  
        the logs which doesn't fit to _required will be moved to _default(automatically logs will be moved these log sinks)
